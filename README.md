# Homeworks for "Java Programming" course

## Task 2. Exceptions

Your task is to implement methods: `impl.expression.ExpressionParserImpl.parse`.
You should write an implementation where TODO is written.

`ExpressionParser` should calculate arithmetic expression `expression`.

`expression` contains integer constants, `+`, `-` and [whitespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character).  
  * All calculations should be done using `int`.
  * There can be no whitespace inside constants.
  * Several `+`, `-` cannot be in a row.
  * Expression parsing should work in linear time.

Pay attention to the processing of possible parsing and calculation errors.
